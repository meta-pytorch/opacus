# Tutorials
This folder contains multiple tutorials to get you started on training differentially private models! We recommend "building_text_classifier.ipynb" to experiment with latest Opacus features such as Fast Gradient Clipping, LoRA, and fine-tuning Hugging Face Transformers.

Note that you may not have all the required packages. You can install opacus's dev version, which will
bring in all the required packages in these tutorials:

```
pip install opacus[dev]
```
